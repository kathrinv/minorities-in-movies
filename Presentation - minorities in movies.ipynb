There has been increased backlash against films that feature white, A-List actors in roles that are portray non-white characters - as such Scarlet Johansson  in Ghost in the Shell, a story based in Japan. Anecdotally, this seems to be bad for business. Casting directors defend their decisions by arguing that the probability of box office failure increases without A list star power. \n",
